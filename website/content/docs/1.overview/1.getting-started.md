NuxtLego is a Nuxt Layer, which enable you to instantly add primitive components into your Nuxt project.

You just have to add the following code into your Nuxt config.

```ts[nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    ...,
    "github:zernonia/nuxt-lego#alpha",    // Currently in Alpha stage
  ]
})
```

### \* Important

Currently Nuxt Layer [doesn't auto-install layer dependencies](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/layers#git-repository), in order for this layer to works well you need to have these dependencies installed.
